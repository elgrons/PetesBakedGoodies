* Code includes two custom classes and uses namespaces. (Bread & Pastry) DONE
* A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastries 
they'd like. DONE
int BreadOrder () Method w/ get set
* Console application works correctly. SO FAR SO GOOD
* Application correctly uses auto-implemented properties. (Get Set) DONE

* Classes should include methods for determining the price of an order.
* The application will return the total cost of the order.
orderTotal() Method displays the total and applies the discount?
divides the total number by 3
and applies discount of x free

* Pete offers the following deal for Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5, then Every 3rd loaf of bread is free:
* Pierre offers the following deal for Pastry: Buy 3, get 1 free. A single pastry costs $2, then Every 4th pastry is free:

swith case:
if order total = 3 price = 2
if order total = 5 price = 3

switch case for speciality pricing?
for loop for each baked good that applies a percentage discount off the total? 
for loop that counts every third as a second item?
if else statement requires a else to work in c#

bread 1 = $5
take in the amount of loaves ordered
apply the discount
give the price

pastry 1 = $2
take in the amount of pastries ordered
apply the discount
give the price


BREAD:
two loaves costs $10
three loaves cost $10 3.33% off
four loaves costs $15
five loaves cost $20
six loaves costs $20  

float discount = 3.33F % off and would need to round up to the decimal point with math.round method (do I need to use floating points for 3.33F) 

would modulo work? % remainder of dividing by 3.33F

change the price to $0 for every third loop?

apply discount at order total? get full price and apply discount in separate method?



seven loaves cost $25

PASTRIES:
two pastries costs $4
three pastries costs $6 
four pastries costs $6
five pastries costs $8 
six pastries costs $10
seven pastries costs $12
eight pastries costs $12

the percentages here aren't as easy to work with, so perhaps a loop would be more direct

Let Marked Price of one item be 100
M.P. of 2+3 items = 500
Actually paid amount = 200
Discount = 300
Discount Percentage = (300/500)*100 % = 60%
So you actually get 60% discount
